## Credits

This project is a fork of the original [Modern Clock](https://github.com/prayag2/kde_modernclock) by [Prayag Jain](https://github.com/prayag2). I would like to thank the original author for creating this beautiful clock widget and making it open source.

The localization feature was inspired by [JortonMV's fork](https://github.com/JortonMV/kde_modernclock/commit/25b87b540ea7903ab4d72174d2f77888d2a7a909). Thanks for the great idea!

The custom font selection feature was inspired by [lunar-d's fork](https://github.com/lunar-d/kde_modernclock_fonts/commit/9a881d1e560a2c30c3defde109aaae81fc27baef). Thanks for the implementation!

The custom time format feature was inspired by [YoannDev90's commit](https://github.com/YoannDev90/kde_modernclock/commit/3a737660982985f1aaf1ede2b374c1d2e4f1b8da), which adds seconds-aware refresh cadence.

This fork combines these improvements while maintaining the modern and clean design of the original.
